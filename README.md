# TTP Project Website

Welcome to the TTP Project, an inclusivity-driven website that harnesses the power of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enhance user engagement and provide personalized experiences. This platform is designed to promote inclusivity within the workspace by connecting individuals through events, mentorship, and tailored content.

## Website Overview

The TTP Project website consists of four main pages, each designed to serve distinct purposes and utilize advanced technologies to cater to user needs:

### 1. Landing Page

This page is designed to be welcoming and informative, ensuring that all visitors, regardless of their familiarity with the platform, can navigate the site effortlessly.

### 2. Events Page

The Events page displays a list of internal company events. It includes static data such as event descriptions, dates, locations, and times.

This system is designed to support newcomers and existing employees by connecting them with more experienced colleagues based on shared interests and professional goals.

**Features:**
- **Embedded NLP Models**: Analyze user profiles and potential mentors to find the best match based on text data.
- **Matching Algorithm**: Uses cosine similarity to ensure that matches are relevant and beneficial.

### 4. Article Recommendation Page

Our Article Recommendation page employs Machine Learning algorithms to ingest and analyze article data, recommending the best articles to users based on their specified interests and topics. This feature keeps users engaged and informed by providing them with content that is most relevant to their professional growth and personal interests.

**Features:**
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Users receive article suggestions that align with their interests.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React used for dynamic components)
- **Backend**: Python for server-side logic
- **Database**: Supabase for storing user data, event details, and articles
- **Machine Learning/NLP**: Python for developing and deploying ML and NLP models
